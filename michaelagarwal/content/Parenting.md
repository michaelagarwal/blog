Being a parent for 19+ years, I learned a thing or two.
     
    
### Being new parent (0-3 year old kids)  
>  
1) First and foremost there is no perfect parent. All you can do in try your best. Trying too hard or setting your own parenting expectations too high can lead to unnecessary frustration.  
2) Don't compare your kids to others, each kid is different and unique, they will develop on their own pace. Whether it is crawling, talking, sitting, walking, learning alphabets, potty training etc, they will do on their own pace, no need to rush it. A little encouragement goes a long way for any type of learning. 
 
### Learning age till teenager (3 - 13 year old kids)  
1) This is the age where they are learning whether it is bicycling, academics, board games, sports, you want to help them learn.  
2) It is important they have healthy balance between relaxation, sports activities, social life and academics. My kids never wanted to do any extra learning or homework so I had to make them do it. We did dedicated study time approximately 1 hour per day, except on Fridays. Initially they resisted but over the time they got used to it. This really helped my kids excel at academics.

### Tennager years
1) These are the years where kids could be friends, you can provide some freedom and let them figure out some things on their own.  
2) You want to nuture them in a way so that they always know what is right thing to do. 
3)
